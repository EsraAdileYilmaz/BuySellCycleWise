Feature: As an administrator, I want to be able to delete Refund&Reason information with the specified ID number
  via the API connection.

  Scenario: When a DELETE body containing valid authorization information and the refund&reason ID to be deleted is sent
  to the /api/refundReasonDelete endpoint, the returned status code should be 202, and the message information
  in the response body should be verified as "refundReason deleted successfully".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
    # APi kullanicisi "admin" token ile base urli olusturur
    * The api user sets "api/refundReasonDelete" path parameters
    # APi kullanicisi "api/refundReasonDelete" path parametrelerini olusturur
    * The api user prepares a DELETE request containing the refund reason ids to be deleted to send to the api refundReasonDelete endpoint.
    # Api kullanicisi api refundReasonDelete endpointine gondermek icin silinmek istenen refund reason idsini iceren bir delete request hazirlar

  Scenario: When a DELETE request body containing valid authorization information and an incorrect (non-existent in the
  system) refund&reason ID is sent to the /api/refundReasonDelete endpoint, the returned status code should be
  404, and the message information in the response body should be verified as "refundReason not found".

    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
    # APi kullanicisi "admin" token ile base urli olusturur
    * The api user sets "api/refundReasonDelete" path parameters
    # APi kullanicisi "api/refundReasonDelete" path parametrelerini olusturur

    # Api kullanicisi api refundReasonDelete endpointine gondermek icin sistemde bulunmayan refund reason idsini iceren bir delete request hazirlar
    * The api user saves the response returned from the api refundReasonDelete endpoint and confirms that the status code is '404' and the reason phrase is Not Found.

  Scenario: When a DELETE body containing invalid authorization information and the refund&reason ID to be deleted is
  sent to the /api/refundReasonDelete endpoint, the returned status code should be 401, and the message

    # Api kullanicisi api refundReasonDelete endpointinden donen responsei kaydeder, status codeun '401' ve reason phrase bilgisinin Unauthorized oldugunu dogrular


  Scenario: The Deleted_Id information in the response body from the /api/refundReasonDelete endpoint should be verified
  to be identical to the id information in the DELETE request body sent to the /api/refundReasonDelete endpoint.
